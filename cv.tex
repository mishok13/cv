\section{Experience}

{\bf Core Developer} Hyves \hfill September 2011 -- present

Hyves is the second biggest social network in Netherlnads and part of the
biggest Dutch media corporation Telegraaf Media Groep. Hyves' focus in recent
years shifted from building social network functionality to end-users to
providing services to 3rd parties, including other parts of Telegraaf Media Groep.
I'm part of the team working on social identity platform, similar to Gigya,
Janrain and the like.

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
\item As part of the 4-man team, designed and developed social identity
  and API integration service, which is already in active use by several
  other projects. The service has been shown to be highly scalable and
  exhibits stable behavior even under real world stress conditions.
  The project is still in active development and the main focus right
  now is providing realtime statistics for 3rd parties.
\item As an official documentation lead of the aforementioned project,
  I have written and still maintain official documentation for both external
  users and the developers team themselves.
\item Was instrumental in moving the default technology stack choice
  from PHP and a set of proprietary libraries to Python and established
  open source libraries, such as Flask, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2, Celery and others.
  Take active part in teaching Python to other developers and system engineers.
\item Developed an internal web tool for editing proprietary i18n format.
  The tool is actively used by both engineering and marketing teams.
\item Active open-source involvement -- libredis, Flask, Flask-DebugToolBar, etc.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Senior Software Engineer,} CloudMade \hfill October 2009 -- August 2011\\
{\bf Software Engineer,} CloudMade \hfill August 2008 -- October 2009

CloudMade is GIS company that uses free
(``free'' as in ``libre'') data from OpenStreetMap project as
the base for its services. I'm responsible for tile and
vector servers development. Authorization servers are also
being supported by me.\\

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
\item Designed and implemented revamped version of the tile
  server. Tile server itself supports
  \href{http://developers.cloudmade.com/projects/show/tiles}{tile} and
  \href{http://developers.cloudmade.com/projects/show/static-maps}{staticmaps}
  services. Tile server was written in Twisted, enabling support for various
  networks protocols used and utilized RabbitMQ for deferring tough rendering
  tasks. Mapnik was used for actual rendering.
  The previous version was an ad hoc mix of C, C++ and Python.
\item Designed and implemented cache management system, which is
  responsible for updating tiles and staticmaps images in the
  background, thus minimizing serve time and overall load on
  services. The software is written in Python and uses RabbitMQ
  (with another backend supporting BDB) for the update queue and
  SimpleDB (interchangable with PostgreSQL or BDB) for storing
  meta-information about each image re-rendered.
\item Designed and implemented vector maps service.
  \href{http://developers.cloudmade.com/projects/show/vector-stream-server}{Vectormaps}
  service is a very important part of
  navigation pack CloudMade provides and is used by many
  mobile applications.
\item Developed Python API
  \href{http://developers.cloudmade.com/projects/show/python-lib}{library}
  from scratch,
  which is  used by developers of Java and Ruby
  libraries as a model to follow.
\item Active open-source involvement -- Mapnik
  (PostGIS plugin, SRTM plugin,
  Python bindings), occasional patches to CPython.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Software Engineer,} Visonic Ltd. \hfill July 2007 -- August 2008

Visonic is an Israel-based manufacturer of security systems.
I was responsible for supporting legacy desktop software and
also got involved into development of several web-based
products.\\

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
\item Supported 10-year old MFC application, used for programming
  embedded devices. Written a Python application, using Qt to
  substitute the older software, but the project was not accepted
  because of management objections.
\item Wrote dozens Python and XSLT scripts
  crunching XML files. Most of these scripts had optional ncurses UI.
\item Created in-house wrapper of
  \href{http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/}{libconfig} using SWIG for initial
  implementation and later rewriting it completely using only Python C API.
  The wrapping library was never released to opensource because of
  internal company decision.
\end{itemize}



{\bf Tech. Support Engineer,} Telesystems of Ukraine \hfill February 2006 -- July 2007

% Tier 1 support
% Worked as tech. support engineer for local ADSL internet
% service provider.\\

% \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
% \item Wrote several Python and shell scripts which
%   automated recurring tasks -- such as checking network
%   interfaces on our routers, adding new user, blocking
%   specific ports on our internal routing network, etc.
%   The scripts themselves didn't use anything besides
%   standard library, the most important being asyncore
%   and asynchat.
% \end{itemize}


{\bf Part-time System Administrator,} Strum \hfill August 2005 -- February 2006

% Part time systems administrator at small research institution.

% \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
